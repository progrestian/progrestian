### Hi! I'm Daniel

I'm a developer currently studying Computer Science at [TU-Dresden](https://tu-dresden.de).
Areas I'm interested in are safe systems programming and high-performance efficient computing.
Currently I'm using Void Linux and mostly write Rust or TypeScript code.
On my spare time I like to make music that resembles those old-school ones from my childhood memories.

### My Projects

Here is a list of some of the public ones:

- [**alam:**](https://github.com/progrestian/alam) simplified ecosystem simulation using ECS, built with React
